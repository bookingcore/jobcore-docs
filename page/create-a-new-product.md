Before adding your first product, let’s get familiar with how product categories, tags, and attributes work.

[Product Categories](/pageproduct-manager/products-category)

[Attribute manager](/pageproduct-manager/attribute-manager)

[Brand manager](/pageproduct-manager/brand-manager)

[Tags manager](/pageproduct-manager/tags-manager)

Adding a Simple product is similar to writing a post:

1. Go to **Dashboard &gt; CATALOG &gt; Products &gt; Add new Product**. You then have a familiar interface and should immediately feel at home.
2. Enter a product **Title** and **Description**.
3. **Publish status**: if you don't need to release this product, you can select Draft to hide it on the list
4. **Is Approved**: this option for admin, in the case the product is not valid, he can disable it
5. **This is a featured product**: tick into the box if you want to set it as the featured
 
**Note**: Virtual products don’t require shipping — an order with virtual products won’t calculate shipping costs.

#### Product Type: 

- **Simple** – covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options. For example, a book.
- **Virtual** – one that doesn’t require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables all shipping related fields such as shipping dimensions. A virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in the cart and checkout.
- **External** – one that you list and describe on your website but is sold elsewhere. Variable – a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a t-shirt is available in different colours and/or sizes.
 
**SKU**, or *Stock Keeping Unit* number, is a unique number assigned to a product for, amongst other things, the purpose of keeping track of inventory, accepting up to 255 characters, which can include alphanumeric values and some special characters

#### Create a simple Product:

After adding a new Product, we need to set the **Product Type &gt; Simple Product**:

**Pricing section**:

1. Regular Price – Item’s normal/regular price
2. Origin Price (Optional) – it must be greater than the price

**The inventory section** allows you to manage stock for the product individually. It enables you to sell products and allows customers to add them to the cart to buy.

**SKU**: which can include alphanumeric values and some special characters

**Stock status**: select in stock or out stock.

On the Attributes tab, you can assign details to a product. You will see a select box containing global attribute sets you created

#### Create a Variable Pro:

To create a Variable product, **Product Type &gt; Variable Product**:

Do the same with the simple product, add the Pricing section + Inventory section + Attribute section.

On this type, we have a Variations section to set up the product:
