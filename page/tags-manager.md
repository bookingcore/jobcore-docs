<p>Product tags are another way to relate products to each other, next to product categories. Contrary to categories, there is no hierarchy in tags; so there are&nbsp;no &ldquo;subtags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tags can be added similarly to adding product categories and work in exactly the same way as post tags.</p>
