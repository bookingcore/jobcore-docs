<p>Orders are created when a customer completes the checkout process, and they are visible to users with Admin and Shop Manager roles only. Each order is given a unique&nbsp;Order ID.</p>
<p><strong>Order statuses</strong> let you know how far along the order is, starting with &ldquo;<strong>Pending payment</strong>&rdquo; and ending with &ldquo;<strong>Completed</strong>.&rdquo; The following order statuses are used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft&nbsp;</strong>&mdash; Order received, no payment initiated. Awaiting payment (unpaid).</li>
<li><strong>Failed&nbsp;</strong>&mdash; Payment failed or was declined (unpaid) or requires authentication (SCA). Note that this status may not show immediately and instead show as&nbsp;Pending&nbsp;until verified (e.g., PayPal).</li>
<li><strong>Processing&nbsp;</strong>&mdash; Payment received (paid) and the stock has been reduced; order is awaiting fulfilment.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Completed&nbsp;</strong>&mdash; Order fulfilled and complete &ndash; requires no further action.</li>
<li><strong>On hold</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Awaiting payment &ndash; stock is reduced, but you need to confirm payment.</li>
<li><strong>Cancelled&nbsp;</strong>&mdash; Canceled by an admin or the customer &ndash; stock is increased, no further action required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Admin can create an Order on the <strong>Dashboard &gt; SALES &gt; Orders &gt; Create Orders</strong> or edit the existing Orders:</p>
