#### **Shipping method:** 

- **Flat Rate**: This allows you to define a standard rate per item, per shipping class, or per order.  
    `10 + ( 2 * [qty] )` â€“ A base shipping cost of $10 plus $2 for each item in the cart.
- **Free Shipping**: By setting the Free Shipping class cost to use 0 \* \[qty\], no matter how many products from that class are added to the cart, the shipping cost will not increase.
- **Local Pickup**: a method that allows the customer to pick up the order themselves. The cost for the option is applied to the entire cart.
 
To add a new Shipping method, please completed the form below:

1. **Method Title**: input title for method
2. **Order no.** : Ordinal number in the list
3. **Choose the shipping method**: select the shipping method
4. **Cost**: The cost for the option, is applied to the entire cart.
